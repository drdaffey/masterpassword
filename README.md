Masterpassword, inspired by PwdHash and Masterpasswordapp.
It's a password manager that generates usernames and passwords based on a string (usually a website), a master password and a salt (generation). Salts are just words from the EFF new short diceware list.
The first time you use Masterpassword, make sure to use the first random generated salt you receive and remember it. Use that Generation each time you need the same password.
